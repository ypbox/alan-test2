The cluster form factor provides both redundancy and scalability of resources. The CCP is logically separated from all data plane traffic, meaning any failure in the control plane does not affect existing data plane operations. User traffic does not pass through the CCP Cluster.\n* Local Control Plane (LCP) – The LCP runs on transport nodes. It is adjacent to the data plane it controls and is connected to the CCP.
